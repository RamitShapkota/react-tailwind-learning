The Full Chain of Command
Interaction: You click the toggle button.

Detection: onChangeBtn sees that the toggle is now "checked" (darkModeStatus is true).

Reporting: onChangeBtn calls darkTheme().

Processing: Inside App.jsx, the state themeMode changes to "dark".

Execution: The useEffect in App.jsx sees the state change and adds the "dark" class to your <html> tag.

Visual Change: Tailwind sees the <html> class and flips the colors on your Card.
