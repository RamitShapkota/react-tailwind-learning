# Custom React Renderer 🚀

A lightweight project that recreates the core logic of a React-like library. This project focuses on understanding how JavaScript objects are transformed into real DOM elements.

## 🧠 Key Learnings

Building this helped me understand:
- **Object Representation**: How to define a UI element as a JavaScript object with `type`, `props`, and `children`.
- **The Render Process**: Creating a `customRender` function that automates DOM creation.
- **Dynamic Attribute Mapping**: Using loops to handle an unlimited number of attributes (href, target, title, etc.) instead of hard-coding them.
- **Under the Hood**: Seeing that "React" isn't magic—it's just JavaScript manipulating the DOM based on specific data structures.
