# React Counter App 🔢

A simple project built to master the **useState** hook in React. This project demonstrates how React "reacts" to data changes and updates the UI automatically.

## 🧠 Concepts Learned

- **State Management**: Understanding that variables don't update the screen, but **State** does.
- **useState Hook**: Learning how to initialize state and use the updater function.
- **Event Handling**: Linking button clicks (`onClick`) to logic functions.
- **Conditional Logic**: Preventing the counter from going into negative numbers or exceeding a specific limit.
