# React Learning Journey 🚀

This folder contains my progress while learning React JS 19.

## Day 02: JSX & Exports
Today I learned:
- How to set up a new React project using Vite.
- The difference between **Named Exports** (`export const App`) and **Default Exports** (`export default App`).
- Why capitalization matters in React components.
- Basic JSX structure.

## How to run
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
